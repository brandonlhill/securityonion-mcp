#!/bin/bash

# This script sets up the runtime environment for the Security Onionâ€“Assemblyline middleware project (so-mcp). 
# Specifically, it performs the following tasks:
#
#    Checks for Python 3
#    Verifies that Python 3 is installed on the system.
#
#    Ensures the venv module is available
#    If the Python venv module is missing, it installs it via apt.
#
#    Creates a Python virtual environment
#    Sets up an isolated Python environment in the .venv/ directory to avoid polluting the global Python environment.
#
#    Activates the virtual environment and upgrades pip
#    Ensures pip is up to date inside the virtual environment.
#
#    Installs Python dependencies
#    Installs packages listed in requirements.txt (if it exists).
#
#    Initializes the configuration file
#    Runs config.py, which ensures that a configuration file is created at ~/.so-mcp/config.ini with the correct structure and secure file permissions (read/write only for the user). If the file is missing or incomplete, config.py prompts the user to enter the necessary values for Elasticsearch connection.
#
#    Makes key project files executable
#    Ensures server.py and run.sh are marked as executable so they can be run directly.
